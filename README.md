To execute the code used for our models, you must first install the required python libraries found in the requirement.txt file. Then you must download the data from the Kaggle competition and place it in a folder called "Kaggle-competition-2" under the main root of the project.

## Naive Bayes
The code for the Naive Bayes testing and training can be found in the collab notebook in the folder "NB_SVM_LIME".

## Kernel SVM
The code for the SVM testing and training can be found in the collab notebook in the folder "NB_SVM_LIME".

## Neural Nets
The code for the training of the Word2Vec encoder is found in the NeuralNet_Encoding notebook in the folder "Neural Net". The code for the tuning and testing of the MLP neural network is found in the NeuralNet_Tuning notebook in the folder "Neural Net". The final training script for the optimal MLP model is in the script NeuralNet_FinalTraining in the folder "Neural Net".

## Best attempt
We found LSTM model as the best suitable model for the classification of sentiments. The code for LSTM model for the training and testing is located in "Best_Attempt" directory, namely `Competition_2_perfect_lstm.ipynb` as colab notebook and the script version of this code is located in `competition_2_perfect_lstm.py`. The actual model and code which was designed in colab notebook at the time of submission is located in `competition_2_perfect_lstm_actual_file_in_competition_submission.ipynb`, this is kept for the record purposes. 

## Explicability
The code for the LIME testing and training can be found in the collab notebook in the folder "NB_SVM_LIME".
